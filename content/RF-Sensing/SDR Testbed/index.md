      title: Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Testbed
      subtitle: Enabling research and experimentation in RF-based posture sensing
      text: |
        As part of the **Deakin RF-Sensing initiative**, we’ve developed a purpose-built **Software-Defined Radio (SDR) testbed** to support real-time experimentation with RF-based sensing applications.

        This testbed provides the foundation for advanced posture monitoring, motion recognition, and environment mapping using low-power, high-resolution RF signals.

        ### ⚙️ Testbed Features

        **1. Flexible SDR Hardware Stack**  
        📶 Built on USRP, HackRF, and RTL-SDR devices to support a wide range of frequencies and protocols, from UHF to Wi-Fi.

        **2. Real-Time Signal Processing Pipelines**  
        🧠 Integrated with GNU Radio and custom Python modules to support live data collection, feature extraction, and deep model inference.

        **3. Ground Truth Alignment Support**  
        🎯 Synchronization tools for pairing RF readings with camera or IMU-based ground truth systems during training phases.

        **4. Plug-and-Play Deployment**  
        🛠️ Easily deployable in new environments — just connect power, set up antennae, and stream data to the central node.

        **5. Remote Access & Cloud Uploads**  
        ☁️ Secure networked access for collaborators to run experiments, update models, or access logs remotely.
