      title: Privacy-Compliant Monitoring with RF Sensing
      subtitle: Non-intrusive human monitoring that protects dignity and data
      text: |
        At the **Deakin RF-Sensing Lab**, we prioritize privacy and ethics in everything we build. Our **Privacy-Compliant Monitoring** solutions offer a radical alternative to surveillance-based tracking by using **non-visual RF signals** to monitor posture, presence, and movement — all without capturing any personal visuals or audio.

        This is especially critical in environments such as aged care, healthcare, and home settings where privacy is not just preferred — it’s essential.

        ### 🔒 Core Privacy Features

        **1. Visual-Free Posture Detection**  
        🚫 No cameras, no image storage, no biometric recordings — just ambient RF signals.

        **2. On-Device Inference**  
        💻 All data processing occurs locally on SDR edge devices, with no personal information sent to cloud servers.

        **3. Anonymized Signal Processing**  
        🔐 RF reflections are analyzed as patterns of motion and shape — not linked to identity or appearance.

        **4. GDPR and HIPAA-Aligned Design**  
        📄 System architectures and data flows are reviewed to comply with global privacy regulations and ethical standards.

        **5. Opt-In Based Monitoring**  
        ✅ Transparent usage with full user consent, and opt-out options for individuals and households.

        ### 🏥 Real-World Application Scenarios

        - Monitoring elderly patients for falls without compromising personal space
        - Smart home setups that balance functionality with full privacy
        - Hospital environments where visual surveillance is ethically restricted

        We believe in a future where technology watches over people — **without watching them**.

        Privacy is not an add-on; it’s built into the very fabric of our systems.
