      title: RF & CKD Pose Estimation
      subtitle: Privacy-safe human posture detection through radio signals
      text: |
        The **Deakin RF-Sensing team** is pioneering a novel approach to human posture detection using **Radio Frequency (RF)** signals and **Correlated Knowledge Distillation (CKD)**. Unlike vision-based systems, our RF-based methods ensure **privacy**, **resilience to occlusion**, and **cost-effective monitoring**.

        This research transforms indoor posture sensing by using ambient radio waves to interpret motion, orientation, and physical activity.

        ### 📡 Key Capabilities

        **1. RF-based Human Pose Estimation**  
        🧍 Utilizing reflected RF signals to map joint positions and full-body posture — without requiring cameras or line-of-sight.

        **2. Knowledge Distillation with Camera-Driven Ground Truth**  
        🎥 Using synchronized camera data to train deep learning models on RF inputs, enhancing accuracy via teacher-student architecture.

        **3. Real-Time Monitoring Under Occlusion**  
        🚪 Detecting posture behind walls, furniture, or curtains where cameras would fail — ideal for elder care and healthcare environments.

        **4. Privacy-Preserving Design**  
        🔐 No visual data is recorded or transmitted, ensuring full compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR.

        **5. Edge Deployment Readiness**  
        🧠 Designed to run on embedded systems or SDR edge nodes for local inference with low latency.
