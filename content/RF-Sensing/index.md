      title: Deakin RF-Sensing
      subtitle: Orchestrating and automating human posture detection and monitoring with state-of-the-art Radio Frequency (RF) and Correlated Knowledge Distillation (CKD).
      text: |
        The Deakin RF-Sensing project is at the forefront of innovative research in human posture detection and monitoring. By leveraging advanced Radio Frequency (RF) sensing and Correlated Knowledge Distillation (CKD), we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of posture monitoring, even in complex scenarios involving occlusions.

        ### Key Features:
        
        - **Pose Estimation, Monitoring & Sensing with RF & CKD**
          - Enabling precise human posture detection through RF signals and CKD techniques, even when occlusions occur.
        
        - **Purpose-built Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Testbed**
          - Developing a dedicated SDR testbed to facilitate testing and real-world applications of RF sensing technologies in posture monitoring.
        
        - **Camera-fed Teacher Class Network & SDR-fed Student Class Network**
          - Utilizing a camera-fed teacher network and SDR-fed student network to enhance posture detection and monitoring through sophisticated machine learning models.
        
        - **Secure & Precise Monitoring for Privacy Compliance**
          - Ensuring that all posture monitoring processes adhere to privacy standards, offering secure and precise monitoring solutions.

        Our research pushes the boundaries of IoT technologies to provide innovative and privacy-compliant solutions for real-time posture detection and monitoring across various industries.
