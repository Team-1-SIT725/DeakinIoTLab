abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of a large corpus of PDF maldocs to identify the key set of significantly important features and help in maldoc detection. Existing industry-based tools for the detection are inefficient and cannot prevent PDF maldocs because they are generic and depend primarily on a signature-based approach. Besides, several other methods developed by academics suffer heavily from reduced effectiveness. The feature-set using machine learning classifiers is prone to various known attacks, such as mimicry and parser confusion. Also, <jats:italic>we discover that increasingly more malicious files i) contain evasive and obfuscated JavaScript code, ii) include hidden contents (mostly outside the objects), iii) have a corrupted document structure, and iv) usually contain short JavaScript code blocks</jats:italic>. We utilise maldoc attacksâ€™ evolution over a decade to highlight the essential features (e.g., concept drifts) that impact detectors and classifiers."
