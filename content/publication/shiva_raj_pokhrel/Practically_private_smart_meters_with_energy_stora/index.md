abstract: "&lt;p&gt;Smart Grid (SG) technology has been invasive to privacy -- the proponents of SG have little assurance that personal data originating from smart meters (SMs) are entirely private. In recent years, new momentum has been building up for a major rethink on the privacy-preserving mechanism for personal SM data, which is essential for efficient utilization of the advances in SG.&lt;/p&gt;"
