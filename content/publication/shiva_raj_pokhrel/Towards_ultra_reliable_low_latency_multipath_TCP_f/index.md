abstract: "Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are Not-So-Futuristic. CAVs will be highly dynamic by intelligently exploiting multipath communication over several radio technologies, such as high-speed WiFi and 5G and beyond networks. Yet, the likelihood of  data  communication  loss  can  be  very  high  and/,  or  packets arrive  at  the  destination  not  in  correct  working  order  due  to erratic and mixed time-varying wireless links. Furthermore, the vehicular  data  traffic  is  susceptible  to  loss  and  delay  variation,which  recommends  the  need  to  investigate  new  multipath  TCP(MPTCP) protocols for ultra-reliable low latency communication(URLLC)  over  such  heterogeneous  networks  while  reassuring CAVsâ€™ needs. We undertake the challenge by jointly considering network  coding  and  balanced  linked  adaptation  for  performing  coupled  congestion  control  across  multiple  wireless  paths.Consequently,  the  proposed  low  delay  MPTCP  framework  for connecting  autonomous  vehicles  is  efficient  and  intelligent  by design.   We   conduct   a   rigorous   convergence   analysis   of   the MPTCP design framework. In summation, we provide a detailed mathematical  study  and  demonstrate  that  the  latency  penalty for the URLLC-MPTCP developed over these networks becomes negligible  when  considering  the  possible  benefits  that  multiple network convergence could offer. Our extensive emulation results demonstrate   all   these   lucrative   features   of   URLLC-MPTCP."
