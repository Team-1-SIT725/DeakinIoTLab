abstract: "We consider future cellular networks and study the coexistence of delay-sensitive (DS) and delay-tolerant (DT) devices in machine-type communication (MTC). DS devices require to minimize access delay for their low delay requirements; in contrast, DT devices have flexible delay constraints."
