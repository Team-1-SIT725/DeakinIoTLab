abstract: "Bufferbloat is one of the leading causes of high data transmission latency and jitter on the Internet, which severely impacts the performance of low-latency interactive applications such as online streaming, cloud-based gaming/applications, Internet of Things (IoT) applications, voice over IP (VoIP), real-time video conferencing, and so forth. There is currently a pressing need for developing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control algorithms and bottleneck queue management schemes that can collaboratively control/reduce end-to-end latency, thus ensuring optimal quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for users. This paper introduces a novel solution by experimentally integrate the low latency, low loss, and scalable throughput (L4S) architecture (specified by the IETF in RFC 9330) in FreeBSD framework with the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm. The first phase involves incorporating a modified dual-queue coupled active queue management (AQM) system for L4S into the FreeBSD networking stack, enhancing queue management and mitigating latency and packet loss. The second phase employs A3C to adjust and fine-tune the system performance dynamically. Finally, we evaluate the proposed solutionâ€™s effectiveness through comprehensive experiments, comparing it with traditional AQM-based systems. This paper contributes to the advancement of machine learning (ML) for transport protocol research in the field. The experimental implementation and results presented in this paper are made available through our GitHub repositories."
