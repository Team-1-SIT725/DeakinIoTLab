abstract: "We are now in the presence of a new medium disguised as good old text, but that text has been generated by an LLM, without authorial intentionâ€”an aspect that, if known beforehand, completely changes the expectations and response a human should have from a piece of text. Should our interpretation capabilities be engaged? If yes, under what conditions? The rules of the language game should be spelled out; they should not be passed over in silence."
