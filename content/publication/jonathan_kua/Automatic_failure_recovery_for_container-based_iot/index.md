abstract: "Recent years have seen the rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, where billions of physical devices are interconnected to provide data sensing, computing and actuating capabilities. IoT-based systems have been extensively deployed across various sectors, such as smart homes, smart cities, smart transport, smart logistics and so forth. Newer paradigms such as edge computing are developed to facilitate computation and data intelligence to be performed closer to IoT devices, hence reducing latency for time-sensitive tasks. However, IoT applications are increasingly being deployed in remote and difficult to reach areas for edge computing scenarios. These deployment locations make upgrading application and dealing with software failures difficult. IoT applications are also increasingly being deployed as containers which offer increased remote management ability but are more complex to configure. This paper proposes an approach for effectively managing, updating and re-configuring container-based IoT software as efficiently, scalably and reliably as possible with minimal downtime upon the detection of software failures. The approach is evaluated using docker container-based IoT application deployments in an edge computing scenario."
