abstract: "This paper proposes a policy management framework which we call the SANIJO framework. This framework comprises three different types of policy rules that are applicable to smart devices for managing their multiuserâ€“multidevice interactions in IoT collectives, from a socio-ethical perspective. We developed a policy language to help regulate and manage the interaction behaviors of smart internet-connected devices that are being deployed at an increasing rate around the world. The policy rules are classified into Authorization, Obligation, and Prohibition rules and are prototyped in the SANIJO system. We implemented our framework as a collection of mobile apps (running on smartphones) and a robot app (running on the robot). We then illustrate its operation based on an aged care center scenario."
