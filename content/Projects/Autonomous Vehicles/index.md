      title: Autonomous Vehicle Systems
      subtitle: Driving innovation in smart mobility
      text: |
        The **Deakin IoT Lab** is pioneering research in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems by combining IoT, AI, edge computing, and advanced sensors to create safe, efficient, and intelligent transportation networks.

        Our focus is on real-world deployable systems that not only move autonomously but also **communicate, collaborate, and adapt** in complex urban and regional environments.

        ### 🚘 Core Research Areas

        **1. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication**  
        🔗 Establishing seamless communication between vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians, and cloud platforms to support safety and coordination.

        **2. Real-Time Edge Decision Making**  
        🧠 Implementing low-latency AI systems on edge devices within vehicles for quick and safe decision-making without reliance on cloud connectivity.

        **3. Sensor Fusion & Environmental Awareness**  
        🌐 Integrating LiDAR, radar, cameras, and ultrasonic sensors for 360-degree situational awareness under all conditions — rain, fog, or night.

        **4. Autonomous Convoying & Platooning**  
        🚛 Researching coordinated movement for fleets of autonomous trucks and service vehicles to optimize logistics and reduce fuel use.

        **5. Simulation & Digital Twins**  
        🧪 Building high-fidelity digital environments to simulate urban AV behaviors and train models safely and efficiently.
