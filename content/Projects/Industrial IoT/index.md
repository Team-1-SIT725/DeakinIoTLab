      title: Industrial IoT (IIoT) for Manufacturing
      subtitle: Optimizing manufacturing through smart, connected technologies
      text: |
        At the **Deakin IoT Lab**, we are redefining how manufacturing operates by embedding intelligence and connectivity into industrial systems. Our **Industrial IoT (IIoT)** research helps factories move toward Industry 4.0 — an era of real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and seamless automation.

        Through partnerships with industry leaders, we build IIoT platforms that are robust, scalable, and tailored to modern manufacturing needs.

        ### 🏭 Key Focus Areas in IIoT Research

        **1. Predictive Maintenance with Smart Sensors**  
        🛠️ Using vibration, temperature, and acoustic sensors to detect anomalies before machine failures occur — reducing downtime and repair costs.

        **2. Real-Time Factory Floor Visibility**  
        📡 Implementing sensor grids and edge computing for live tracking of machine performance, worker safety, and resource consumption.

        **3. AI-Enhanced Quality Control**  
        📷 Integrating computer vision and ML models to detect defects on the production line and ensure consistent output quality.

        **4. Supply Chain Integration**  
        🔗 Leveraging IoT for inventory tracking, logistics automation, and real-time supplier coordination.

        **5. Energy Efficiency Optimization**  
        ⚡ Monitoring equipment-level energy usage and implementing dynamic load balancing to reduce electricity waste.
