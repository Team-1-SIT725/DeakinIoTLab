      subtitle: Smart farming for a sustainable future
      text: |
        Welcome to the **AgriTech research division** of the Deakin IoT Lab, where innovation meets agriculture. We integrate cutting-edge IoT technologies with data science and AI to transform farming into a smart, sustainable, and efficient practice.

        Our solutions are aimed at improving crop yields, reducing water and resource wastage, and enabling farmers to make better real-time decisions through data.

        ### 🌱 Core Innovations

        **1. Smart Soil and Crop Monitoring**  
        🌾 Deploying sensor networks across fields to measure moisture, nutrients, and pH levels, enabling precise irrigation and fertilizer delivery.

        **2. Climate-Aware Farming Systems**  
        🌤 Using real-time weather feeds, AI models, and historical patterns to provide proactive climate adaptation guidance for farms.

        **3. Automated Livestock Management**  
        🐄 Integrating RFID tags, smart wearables, and GPS trackers to monitor herd health, reduce losses, and boost productivity.

        **4. Drone & Satellite Integration**  
        🚁 Using NDVI imaging and drone-based crop mapping to detect diseases early, assess yield potential, and plan harvests.

        **5. Data-Driven Dashboards**  
        📊 Farmers receive customized, easy-to-use dashboards to track farm health, receive alerts, and make data-backed decisions.
