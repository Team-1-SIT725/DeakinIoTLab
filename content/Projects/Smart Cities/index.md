        ### 🏙️ Key Innovations in Smart City Infrastructure

        **1. Smart Waste Management**  
        🚮 Using fill-level sensors and route optimization algorithms to minimize fuel use and improve sanitation efficiency.

        **2. Intelligent Lighting Systems**  
        💡 Deploying adaptive LED streetlights that respond to real-time traffic and pedestrian activity, reducing energy consumption by up to 50%.

        **3. Air Quality and Noise Monitoring**  
        🌫️ Installing sensor nodes to monitor urban pollutants and noise, helping municipalities take targeted, data-backed actions.

        **4. Smart Parking and Traffic Flow**  
        🚗 IoT-enabled parking space detection and traffic signal optimization to reduce congestion and improve commuter experience.

        **5. Sustainable Urban Water Management**  
        💧 Integrating IoT with stormwater and greywater systems to monitor usage, prevent overflow, and ensure water conservation.

        ### 🤝 Collaboration and Community Impact

        Our work supports city councils, environmental agencies, and technology vendors to co-create smarter public services:

        - Pilot programs with Geelong and Ballarat City Councils
        - 40% reduction in public lighting electricity usage
        - Real-time dashboards used by emergency services during floods and bushfires
