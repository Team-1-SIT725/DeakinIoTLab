        ### 🚀 Core Focus Areas

        **1. Congestion-Aware Protocols**  
        🌐 Using deep learning to detect and respond to congestion patterns in real time — minimizing latency and packet loss.

        **2. Adaptive Data Compression and Encoding**  
        📦 Applying intelligent compression techniques to reduce transmission size while preserving critical information.

        **3. Semantic-Aware Communication**  
        🧠 Prioritizing data based on context and meaning — sending only what matters to reduce redundancy and improve relevance.

        **4. Cross-Layer Protocol Optimization**  
        🔄 Coordinating application, transport, and physical layers for end-to-end efficiency using AI-based feedback loops.

        **5. Energy-Aware Transmission Planning**  
        ⚡ Designing protocols that optimize communication schedules based on power availability and device duty cycles.
