        ### 📡 Key Research Areas

        **1. Multimodal Sensor Integration**  
        🧭 Combining data from temperature, humidity, motion, air quality, sound, and image sensors for richer environmental understanding.

        **2. Low-Power, High-Precision Sensing**  
        🔋 Developing energy-efficient sensors capable of long-term, accurate monitoring in harsh or remote conditions.

        **3. Edge Analytics and Local Processing**  
        🧠 Running lightweight ML models on microcontrollers and edge devices to reduce latency and network dependency.

        **4. Anomaly Detection and Predictive Modeling**  
        📈 Using real-time data streams to predict failures, detect outliers, and improve operational efficiency.

        **5. Sensor Data Visualization and Interaction**  
        📊 Building interactive dashboards and interfaces to help users explore, monitor, and respond to sensor-derived insights.
