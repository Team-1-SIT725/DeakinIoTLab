      title: IoT Platforms and Interoperability
      subtitle: Creating unified ecosystems for connected technologies
      text: |
        The **Deakin IoT Lab** is dedicated to building robust and flexible IoT platforms that allow devices, sensors, and services to **seamlessly communicate and interoperate**.

        With the explosion of connected devices across homes, industries, and cities, our focus is to eliminate fragmentation and ensure **scalability, reliability, and standardization** in IoT systems.

        ### 🧩 Research Highlights

        **1. Cross-Vendor Device Integration**  
        🔄 Designing middleware and APIs that support diverse hardware and protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, LoRaWAN).

        **2. Open Standards & Protocol Harmonization**  
        ⚙️ Contributing to efforts in standardizing IoT communication to ensure compatibility across manufacturers and platforms.

        **3. Edge-Cloud Hybrid Architectures**  
        🌐 Creating architectures where real-time tasks run at the edge, while complex analytics are handled in the cloud — achieving both speed and scalability.

        **4. Security and Identity Management**  
        🔐 Implementing secure onboarding, authentication, and data encryption across interconnected platforms.

        **5. Low-Code and No-Code IoT Interfaces**  
        🧱 Empowering developers and non-technical users to deploy IoT workflows using intuitive visual tools.
